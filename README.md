# TraceITS
## Abstract
Awareness of the importance of systems and software traceability and tool support for 
traceability have improved over the years. However, an effective traceability solution
must align with an organization’s engineering processes. Specifically, the phases of
the traceability process model (traceability strategy, creation, use and maintenance of
traceability) must be aligned with the organization’s engineering processes. Previous
research has discussed the benefits of integrating traceability into the configuration
management process. This research proposes a process based on Model-Driven Engineering
(MDE) where traceability is integrated into Change Request (CR) management.
In this process, traceability is managed with the status of the CR; for
example, traceability is used to report the progress of the implementation of a CR.
The proof of concept of the integrated process is demonstrated with a tool, Traceability
Centric Issue Tracking System (TraceITS), based on Eclipse Modelling Tools
and Epsilon model management framework. A preliminary evaluation of TraceITS
indicates several advantages over regular ITS.
